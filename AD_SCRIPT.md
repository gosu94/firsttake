## Notes

- Early beats work best with a restrained **cinematic / trailer-style** narration.
- Mid-to-late beats should transition into a **professional commercial** tone.
- Script is intentionally self-referential to demonstrate the product in action.
- Emphasis is placed on **control**, **simplicity**, and **low cognitive load**.
